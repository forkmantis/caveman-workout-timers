# Forkmantis's Caveman Workout Timer Data

This repo contains the custom timers I've made for use in the [Cavemantraining Advanced Workout Timer](https://www.cavemantraining.com/workout-timer/android/).  I like the app because it let's me program in very customized workouts with repeating blocks, fixed or flexible times, and custom audio prompts so I can easily know where I'm at in a workout.

## Simple/Sinister

The first 2 timers are based on Pavel Tstatsouline's [Simple and Sinister](https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G) kettlebell program.  There is a timed and a timeless version for the program.  The timeless version is the day-to-day workout, and uses stopwatches, so you can complete each set at your own pace, but not lose track of where you are in the workout.  The timed version has fixed times, and would be used to measure completion of either the Simple or Sinister goal.

## Shoulder Stretching

I've been dealing with shoulder pain off and on for the last few years.  At the time of this writing, I've begun following the advanced program prescribed in Jim Johnson's [Treat Your Own Rotator Cuff](https://www.amazon.com/Treat-Your-Own-Rotator-Cuff/dp/1598582062).  This timer has fixed 30 second times for the stretches in the program, and 12 second transtions to allow you to move from one stretch to the next.
